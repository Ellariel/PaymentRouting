# PaymentRouting
Algorithms for routing in payment channel networks 

Based on GTNA (https://github.com/BenjaminSchiller/GTNA), this simulator allows you to design and analyze routing protocols 
payment channel networks 

Select a test to run in class PaymentTest, which either run some key algorithms on a small test graph stored in the data folder 
or generates Barabasi Albert or ErdosRenyi graphs to run the algorithms on

Used for our evaluation in the paper 'Splitting payments locally while routing interdimensionally' 
(See evaluation for the setup, Lightning snapshot used the evaluation is available in folder lightning)
